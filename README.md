# tvApp
Siple application created for recrutation process in company I'm applying to.

How to use this app? You can download files from this repo and upload them on your own server with your own modifications. 
If you just want to try it or use it to check incoming tv shows, you can visit website where I host it: http://madecki.pl/tvApp.

Functionality: 

1. Shows browser is a list with dynamic pagination. Click on any part of a show's row and see detailed description, show's cover picture.
2. Search engine and pagination adjustments. If you look for a topic, keyword, someone's name you should just type it into search box 
on the top of the page. It will dinamically adjust shows list by selecting only matching ones. If you want to adjust amount of shows on 
one page you can do it a) on the top of the page, next to search box in desktop version b) on the bottom, next to the pages list. 
3. Favorites. You can mark any show as you favourite by clicking gray star in the show's detailed description view. You can un-do it by 
clicking gold star once again. Thanks to this functionality you can see favourite shows on special list on main view. Important: search
filter and pagination settings doesn't affect that list. 

App compatibility: 
It has been verified with W3C validator with 100% success. I also checked it on 4,7" iPhone, 9.7" iPad, 2560x1440 display, 720p, 
1080p and 4K tv and on following browsers: Google Chrome 55, Internet Explorer 11, Microsoft Edge, Firefox 50, Opera 42 and Safari 10.
